dashtoon assignment

The dataset used was "best-artworks-of-all-time" from kaggle.
The dataset contains artists and their painting's images


FIRST PART OF THE CODE IS TRAINED ON DATASET OF ARTIST'S IMAGES.
THE MODEL IS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION OF ARTIST IMAGES
MODEL USED IS RESNET50

REALIZATION HIT AND I REALZED THAT IS NOT THE TASK OF THE ASSIGNMENT 

SO A VGG19 MODEL IS USED TO TRAIN THE IMAGES ON THE STYLE OF A SINGLE ARTIST (VINCENT VAN GOGH IS CHOSEN AS THE DATASET HAD MAX IMAGES OF THE SAID ARTIST)

THE TRAINED MODEL WEIGHTS IS THEN UTILIZED FOR NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER 
ON THE BASE IMAGE USING AN STYLE IMAGE OF THE THE ARTIST 
THE MODEL OUTPUTS A STYLIZED IMAGE 

ALL WEIGHTS OF THE MODEL (BOTH CLASSIFICATION AND THE VGG19STYLE REGRESSION ) ARE UPLOADED IN GDRIVE
